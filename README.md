# Android-Script-Auto-updater

How to use

Add this line on the top of your script (if not have):

ver="VERSION_OF_YOUR_SCRIPT"

And after the lines of the file of this repository called "Your Script".

In this script add the version of your script in {version=""}, if you have it:

ver=1.0_ilikebigbutts_stable

Then add in this script like:

version="1.0_ilikebigbutts_stable"

Add on this script the download URL of your script on {download=""} like this:

download="https://github.com/Bill-Gates/releases/download/69/Windows-69-Kamasutra-128-Bits-BlackRay18.iso"

Can create a repository and use "Releases" to upload as this script as your script with the same tag always.

When update your script, delete the old release and modify the {version""} of this script and in your script too and upload with the same tag that before.
